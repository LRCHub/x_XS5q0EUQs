[00:54.85] She calls out to the man on the street
[01:00.15] "Sir, can you help me?
[01:04.55] It's cold, and I've nowhere to sleep
[01:09.18] Is there somewhere, you can tell me?"
[01:27.68] 
[01:13.93] He walks on, doesn't look back
[01:18.52] He pretends he can't hear her
[01:23.43] Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
[01:27.88] Seems embarrassed to be there
[01:42.38] 
[01:32.33] Oh, think twice
[01:36.00] 'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
[01:41.82] Oh, think twice
[01:45.53] 'Cause it's another day for you
[01:48.68] You and me in paradise
[01:59.68] 
[01:59.97] Think about it
[02:06.97] 
[02:10.15] She calls out to the man on the street
[02:14.89] He can see she's been crying
[02:19.63] She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
[02:24.67] She can't walk, but she's trying
[02:40.67] 
[02:28.87] Oh, think twice
[02:32.75] 'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
[02:38.23] Oh, think twice
[02:42.15] It's just another day for you
[02:45.24] You and me in paradise (para-paradise)
[03:04.24] 
[02:56.10] Just think about it
[03:05.60] 
[03:07.76] Oh Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do?
[03:15.97] Oh Lord, there must be something you can say
[03:37.97] 
[03:28.01] You can tell from the lines on her face
[03:32.78] You can see that she's been there
[03:37.15] Probably been moved on from every place
[03:42.11] 'Cause she didn't fit in there
[03:57.11] 
[03:46.73] Oh, think twice
[03:50.41] 'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
[03:55.97] Oh, think twice
[03:59.69] It's just another day for you
[04:02.99] You and me in paradise (para-paradise)
[04:21.99] 
[04:09.09] Just think about it
[04:18.92] Think about it
[04:25.92] 
[04:23.53] It's just another day for you and me in paradise
[04:32.68] It's just another day for you and me in paradise, (para-paradise), paradise
[04:42.15] (It's just another day for you and me in paradise) ooh, just think about it
[04:51.74] Paradise (it's just another day for you and me)
[04:56.20] Just think about it (in paradise, para-paradise)
[05:01.00] (It's just another day for you and me) ooh, in paradise
[05:06.13] Mm, paradise (in paradise)
[05:10.58] (It's just another day) paradise
[05:13.55] (For you and me in paradise) just another day in paradise
[05:17.52] (Para-paradise)
