She calls out to the man
on the street
Sir can you help me
It's cold
and I've nowhere to sleep
Is there somewhere
you can tell me
He walks on doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle
As he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there
Oh think twice
It's another 4 day for
you and me In paradise
Oh think twice
It's just another day for
you In this paradise
Just think about it
<♪>
She calls out to the man
on the street
He can see she's been crying
Shen's got blisters
On the soles of her feet
She can't walk but she's trying
Oh think twice
It's another 4 day for
you and me In paradise
Oh think twice
It's just another day for
you In this paradise
Just think about it
<♪>
Oh lord is there nothing more
Anybody can do
Oh lord there must be something
you can say
You can tell From the lines
on her face
You can see
That she's been there
Probably been moved on
From every place
Cause she didn't fit in there
Oh think twice
It's another 4 day for
you and me In paradise
Oh think twice
It's just another day for
you In this paradise
Just think about it
Just think about it
It's just another day for
you and me In paradise
It's just another day for
you In this paradise
It's just another day for
you and me In paradise
It's just another day for
you In this paradise
It's just another day for
you and me
It's just another day for
you and me
It's just another day for
you and me In paradise
