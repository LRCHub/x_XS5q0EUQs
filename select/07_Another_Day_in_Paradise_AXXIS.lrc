[01:00.94] He walks on, doesn't look back He pretends he can't hear her Starts to whistle as he crosses the street Seems embarrassed to be there
[01:18.99] Oh think twice, it's another day for You and me in paradise Oh think twice, it's just another day for you, You and me in paradise
[01:56.12] She calls out to the man on the street He can see she's been crying She's got blisters on the soles of her feet Can't walk but she's trying
[02:14.32] Oh think twice...
[02:51.91] Oh lord, is there nothing more anybody can do Oh lord, there must be something you can say
[03:12.31] You can tell from the lines on her face You can see that she's been there Probably been moved on from every place 'Cos she didn't fit in there
[03:30.57] Oh think twice...
