Rise and praise the hungry sky
Another day in paradise
This pantheon franchises dreams
Potemkin zealot, you ain't guaranteed
Endless sainted light

Your rented cell's a trap to feed
A hallowed spot you barely keep
So get them swaying, draw a crowd
Seed your word inside their mouths

You're praying smarter
You're praying harder
You're spieling your blessings
Like a street-corner barker
'Cuz you can't be shy, seeking favor divine
It's a victimless sin to build your schtick a shrine

And there's no percentage in heaven
Knowing your woes
In the pros, you've got peers
Who'd give up a limb
To shiv and supplant you
So buck up, heed those better angels
Offer bland benedictions and false cheer

And with a little luck
Plus some real proselytic talk
You'll ascend above the muck
Gain traction in the empyrean
Meet the gatekeepers, grip their grease
Exalt the flock you plan to fleece
Preach pro bono, damn the costs
Enrich your soul before your grace is lost

So whenever your account is down
Look on the bright side
Until the jig's up and you're cast out
You can still bathe
In every dawn's fanged limelight
Here in paradise
